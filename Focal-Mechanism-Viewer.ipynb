These plots are made in Python using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [mplstereonet](https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet).  The two exercises here will get you to:\n",
    "1. Play around with finding the auxillary plane to a nodal plane to get to grips with drawing orthogonal planes constrained such that the slip-vector of one-plane is the normal to the other.\n",
